# Attention on Notification - Chrome

Chrome extension that causes browser window in taskbar to blink when website displays Desktop Notification.

This is useful when using Web Apps (GMail, Slack, ...) that use Desktop Notifications but you want to make sure that you don't miss them.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to local folder
2. In Chrome, go to Menu->More tools...->Extensions
3. Check "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked extension..."
5. Select folder where you cloned this repository
6. Enable notifications in desired Web App

I also recommend making Web Apps separate windows by doing the following:

1. In Chrome, with Web App tab focused, go to Menu->More tools...->Add to desktop...
2. Check "Open as Window" and click Add
3. Start Web App shortcut from desktop
